\label{ch:abstract}
In recent years, the automotive industry was heavily shaped by the desire to increasingly automated driving tasks. This trend is motivated by statistical findings which indicate that the majority of traffic fatalities are cause by human error \cite{world2018global}. In order to automate driving tasks, the necessity arises to provide an environmental representation to the vehicle which encapsulates the location an motion state of objects in its close proximity. One commonly used environment representation are the so called occupancy maps. These maps are created by temporally accumulating the occupancy information provided by a diverse set of sensors like cameras, lidars, radars or ultrasonic sensors. To obtain the occupancy information for given sensor measurements, a transformation called \gls{ism} is applied. These models can either be handcrafted or, as recently proposed, learned from data. 
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep,nolistsep]
	\item behavior of handcrafted \gls{ism}s is well understood
	\item ... BUT capturing every edge case is a difficult task
	\item on the other hand, learned models 
	\item the aim of this work is to combine both worlds
\end{enumerate}
